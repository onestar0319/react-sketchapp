# Foursquare + Google Maps

## How to use
Download the example or [clone the repo](http://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp):
```
curl https://codeload.github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 react-sketchapp-master/examples/foursquare-maps
cd foursquare-maps
```

Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Run it in Sketch
Run with live reloading in Sketch
```
npm run render
```

Or, to install as a Sketch plugin:
```
npm run build
npm run link-plugin
```

Then, open Sketch and navigate to `Plugins → react-sketchapp: Foursquare + Google Maps`

### Run it in your browser

```
npm run web
```

Open a browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## The idea behind the example

Creating maps with live data into Sketch is notoriously difficult — until now ;)

This example is created with `react-primitives` and renders simultaneously to Sketch & Web, and polyfills `fetch` in Sketch with [`sketch-module-fetch-polyfill`](https://github.com/mathieudutour/sketch-module-fetch-polyfill) (automatically imported by `skpm`).
