- ðŸ¦„ Render React components to Sketch.app!
- ðŸ¦„ Use flexbox for layout!
- ðŸ¦„ Build Sketch documents with real data!
- ðŸ¦„ Share styles & components between platforms!

## Motivation
`react-sketchapp` evolved out of our need to generate high-quality, consistent Sketch assets for our design system at Airbnb. Wrapping Sketchâ€™s imperative API is a pragmatic solution for consistent & predictable rendering. By using the same component API as `react-native`â€”`<View />`, `<Text />`, `<Image />` instead of `<Rect />`, `<Oval />` etcâ€”we can use the same layout algorithms and components across multiple platforms.

Existing plugins try to go from Sketch to the browser (CSS, HTML, sometimes even components) â€” for our use case this is the wrong model. By inverting the system we can keep our source of truth in code, and treat Sketch as a pure render function.

## Running example scripts
Make sure Sketch automatically reloads plugins:
```bash
defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3.plist AlwaysReloadScript -bool YES
```

Clone & build the repo, and symlink the examples:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jongold/react-sketchapp.git && cd react-sketchapp
npm install && npm run build:plugin
./symlink-plugin.sh
```

Open Sketch; examples will be in `Plugins â†’ react-example`.
