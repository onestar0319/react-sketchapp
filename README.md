## Features

* **Declarative.** All the lessons we've learnt from the React model of programming. A comfortable layer over Sketchâ€™s API.
* **Familiar.** Flexbox layouts. `react-native` components. You already know how to use `react-sketchapp`.
* **Data-based.** Pipe in real data from JSON files, APIs, and databases.
* **Universal.** Start from scratch, or use your existing component libraries

## Usage
`react-sketchapp` projects are implemented as [Sketch plugins](http://developer.sketchapp.com/).

There are several ways to build Sketch plugins:

### Using a template
The simplest way to build Sketch plugins with modern JavaScript is [`skpm`](https://github.com/sketch-pm/skpm) ðŸ’ŽðŸ“¦ with the `react-sketchapp-skpm-example` template. Feel free to remove anything you're not using.

Install `skpm`, if you don't have it already:
```bash
npm install -g skpm
```

create a new project:
```bash
mkdir my-rad-sketch-plugin
cd my-rad-sketch-plugin
# Initialize this plugin with the template
skpm init git+ssh://git@github.com:jongold/react-sketchapp-skpm-example.git
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Setup an alias from the .sketchplugin to the sketch plugins folder
skpm link .
```

Then, to build your plugin (will auto update when you change the code)
```bash
npm run watch
```

And write your plugin in `src/my-command.js`
```js
import React from 'react';
import { render, Text, View } from 'react-sketchapp';

const Document = props =>
  <View>
    <Text>Hello world!</Text>
  </View>;

export default function (context) {
  render(<Document />, context);
}
```

Run your plugin in Sketch via `Plugins â†’ [your plugin name] â†’ my-command`.

Refer to the [skpm docs](https://github.com/sketch-pm/skpm) for more information about skpm.

### The manual way

Feel free to use whatever build process you're comfortable with â€” just [disable CocoaScript](http://developer.sketchapp.com/introduction/plugin-bundles/#disablecocoascriptpreprocessor) and disabled [Sketch's caching mechanism](http://developer.sketchapp.com/introduction/preferences#always-reload-scripts-before-running)
```
defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3.plist AlwaysReloadScript -bool YES
```

You can then use [react-native-packager](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/packager), [rollup](http://rollupjs.org/), [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) etc.

[`react-sketchapp-webpack-example`](http://github.com/jongold/react-sketchapp-webpack-example) is a minimal boilerplace to start developing with Webpack.

### Examples
`react-sketchapp` includes [a folder of examples](example-plugin/) showing how you might use it to work with a JavaScript [design system](example-plugin/designSystem.js).
* [Styleguide](example-plugin/Styleguide.js)
* [Twitter-style profiles](example-plugin/Profiles.js)

Clone & build the repo, and symlink the examples:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:airbnb/react-sketchapp.git && cd react-sketchapp
npm install && npm run build:plugin
./symlink-plugin.sh
```

Open Sketch; examples will be in `Plugins â†’ react-example`.
