# Usage
`react-sketchapp` projects are implemented as Sketch plugins. We recommend disabling CocoaScript, and using a module bundler to compile into plugins that Sketch can run.

## Examples
react-sketchapp includes [a folder of examples](example-plugin/). We use it internally when developing new features â€” it may change as we update the API.

[react-sketchapp-starter](http://github.com/jongold/react-sketchapp-starter) is a minimal boilerplace to start developing your own plugin.
